# nicu_hrv_analysis
The purpose of this repository is to showcase my project in the analysis of heart rate variability in preterm neonates to predict sepsis. This work was academic in nature, but my intended audience consists of potential employers.

This project demonstrates:
  1) Experience with key Python libraries used by data scientists, including pandas and matplotlib,
  2) Experience with data cleaning, particularly the cleaning of physiological time series data, and
  3) My ability to self teach an application area about which I knew nothing at the start.
  
Currently, I am very nearly done with a write up about this project. Once it is complete, I will consider this respository presentable and will include in on my resume for employers to review.
