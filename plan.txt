1) Find that external hard drive, grab the deidentified data
2) Write easy to use code that takes data from that harddrive and produces the interactive
   plots
3) Create a write up of the project
4) Write a good read me for git
5) Create an elevator interview script for the project
DONE

Okay, I have the external hard drive now. I am going to write up a to do list for tomorrow.
I sure hope there's enough space on that hard drive to hold all of the data. If not, I'll 
have to weigh my options. 

This year is coming into its final days, but if I work patiently, I believe I can have this
repository ready to show off by the end of the year.

Row your boat.







Then:
1) Read more about survival analysis; make sure that your approach is theoretically valid
2) Create a diagram of the data pipeline
3) Create one example
4) Use that example as something to push through the pipeline, making sure everything works.
   Take notes of time complexities as you do this.
5) Produce a small set of examples and push them all through, see if there are any
   interesting results.
6) From this small analysis, generate a list of hypotheses and then design more robust tests

The purpose of this study is to understand the extinction time of messages injected into
random networks supporting a particular stochastic cellular automaton, here dubbed the
brancher-annihilator. In particular, we use techniques from survival analysis to generate
estimates of the extinction hazard function, and then we regress on network parameters to
investigate the relationship between network structure and network function.
